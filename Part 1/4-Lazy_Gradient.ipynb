    "\n",
    "Training deep learning models with large batch sizes can be difficult due to memory limitations, especially when using large datasets or deep networks. **Gradient Accumulation** is a technique that allows us to simulate large batch sizes without increasing memory usage. This tutorial will cover:\n",

    "## 2. Theory Behind Gradient Accumulation\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 What is Gradient Accumulation?\n",
    "Instead of updating the model parameters after every mini-batch, **Gradient Accumulation** allows us to accumulate gradients over multiple mini-batches before performing an update. This effectively simulates training with a larger batch size.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Why Use Gradient Accumulation?\n",
    "- **Overcome Memory Limits**: Training with large batch sizes often exceeds GPU memory capacity. Accumulating gradients allows training on smaller mini-batches while maintaining the benefits of larger batch training.\n",
    "- **Stable Training**: Larger batch sizes help in stable updates and reducing variance in gradient estimation.\n",
    "- **Effective Batch Size**: If GPU memory allows batch size `B` but we need `N`, we can accumulate gradients for `N/B` steps before updating.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3 How Does It Work?\n",
    "If `loss` is computed on `batch_size = B`, instead of calling `optimizer.step()` every step, we:\n",
    "1. Compute gradients on `B` and accumulate them.\n",
    "2. Repeat for `K` iterations, accumulating gradients.\n",
    "3. Update weights only after `K` steps.\n",
    "4. Reset gradients after update.\n",
    "\n",
    "This results in an **effective batch size** of `B * K` without needing extra memory.\n"

    "What are Second-Order Gradients?\n",
    "\n",
    "In deep learning, second-order gradients refer to the derivatives of gradients (i.e., the second derivative of a loss function with respect to model parameters). These are commonly used in optimization methods that require information about the curvature of the loss function.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Mathematically**:\n",
    "- **First-order gradient**: $ g = \\nabla_\\theta L(\\theta) $ (gradient of loss $ L $ w.r.t. parameters $ \\theta $)\n",
    "- **Second-order gradient (Hessian)**: $ H = \\nabla^2_\\theta L(\\theta) $ (derivative of $ g $, which captures curvature)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###**Why Use Second-Order Gradients?**\n",
    "\n",
    " *   Better Optimization – Second-order methods like Newton’s Method use curvature information to converge faster than first-order methods (like SGD).\n",
    " *    Natural Gradient Descent – Second-order gradients help in adapting the learning rate in different directions based on the Hessian matrix.\n",
    " *   Meta-Learning – Algorithms like MAML (Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning) require second-order gradients to update learning rates.\n",
    " *   Adversarial Training – Computing second-order derivatives is useful for generating adversarial examples.\n",
